;; deep-all-x? : list x -> boolean
;; deep-all-x? receives a list containing other lists (deep list) and a element x.
;; The function returns true if every single element in the list of lists is x. Otherwise it returns false.

;; Example
;; (deep-all-x? '(a (b (c d)) e (f g)) 'a)

;; (deep-all-x? '(2 (2 (2 2)) 2 (2 2)) '2)
